# Step 1: Build the Spring Boot application
# Use an official Maven image to build the application
 
# Set the working directory
 
# Copy the pom.xml and source code into the container
 
# Run Maven to build the application (creates the .jar file)
 
# Step 2: Prepare the runtime environment
# Use a slim OpenJDK image to run the application
 
# Set the working directory for the runtime container
 
# Copy the compiled jar file from the build stage
 
# Expose the port the application will run on
 
# Command to run the application
